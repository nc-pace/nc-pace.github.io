The North Carolina Partnership for Cybersecurity Excellence (NC-PaCE) is a coalition of
educational, government, and industry organizations committed to accelerating the state’s and the nation's
pace of cybersecurity excellence in education, research, and services to counter cyber threats. NC-PaCE
will address a growing cybersecurity workforce gap through targeted curriculum development, skills development, work-based learning, and certification support; will protect financial assets and intellectual property (IP); and will drive the economic growth of North Carolina’s public agencies and private sector businesses through cybersecurity research and service. Synergistically, NC-PaCE supports entrepreneurial and economic growth in North Carolina.
